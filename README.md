# 🕵️‍♀️ Credit Card Fraud Detection – Label Validation Report

## 📌 Project Goal
Build a Power BI dashboard to explore fraudulent transaction patterns in a public dataset.  
However, after cleaning and validation, it was discovered that the dataset contains **no fraud labels** (`is_fraud = 1`), which highlights a real-world data integrity issue.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Excel (Data Cleaning)
- Power BI Desktop (Dashboard & Visualization)
- GitHub (Documentation & Version Control)

---

## 📊 Dashboard Summary
Even though fraud labels were missing, a detailed dashboard was created to:
- Analyze transaction volumes by category and state
- Validate data integrity issues and fraud label presence
- Demonstrate clean design and layout of a real-world dashboard project
